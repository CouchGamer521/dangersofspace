        <p class="paragraph1">Gamma-ray bursts can do substantial harm to the earth and especially its atmosphere. A local gamma-ray burst (GRB) is the result of nearby stars colliding together and causing large bursts of energy. These bursts create large amounts of gamma radiation which is very harmful to the earth. A study found that a significant local gamma-ray burst may have occurred before. It was said to be the cause of a large extinction. As said by Doyle, “The Ordovician extinction — one of the “big five” in Earth’s history — occurred around 450 million years ago when the population of marine species plummeted. Evidence suggests that this occurred during an ice age and a gamma-ray burst is one of several possible mechanisms that may have triggered this extinction event” (Para. 2). Thus said, another gamma-ray burst happening now could mean the end of humanity as we know it. Large scale gamma-ray bursts create a lot of gamma and UV radiation. UV radiation, when hitting the atmosphere at large amounts, would cause the ozone layer to quickly evaporate. As UV rays hit the ozone layer, the oxygen would split apart do to a chemical reaction. This would leave the earth vulnerable to the sun's radiation and would be disastrous for humanity. Though there is a bright side. “A GRB could happen over any latitude or time but we chose the South Pole mainly to look at a very high depletion case,” explains Thomas. “When the radiation enters the atmosphere over a pole, the depletion is concentrated there instead of spread around the globe.” (Para. 7). If the radiation hit the pole then we would remain unaffected for the most part, though the ground level ozone that would form would hurt the ocean life around there.
	<br />A supernova is created when a star explodes and ejects most of its mass. Supernovas can send comets as well as gamma rays into the universe. A supernova occurring in our solar system could have a significant impact on the earth. But is there a way to prevent or protect against these things? As of now no. There are ideas in the works but none are set in stone, sadly.
