	<p class="paragraph1">Black holes are elusive and extremely dangerous to everything around them. Luckily, black holes are an uncommon occurrence. As said by O’Callaghan, “it is more likely that the Earth will get swallowed by a black hole than, say, winning the lottery ten times in a row, but less likely than being struck by lightning. In fact, the odds of a black hole devouring our planet are estimated at one in a trillion.” (Para. 1). Though the odds are very, very low, what if the earth was in that one trillionth possibility? First, it must be discussed what a black hole is. A black hole can be defined as a small portion of space holding a very large gravitational pull, in which not even light can escape it. Black holes fit into two main categories, supermassive black holes and interstellar black holes. Supermassive black holes normally are the center of many galaxies and pose no threat to earth. Interstellar black holes, on the other hand, are formed from stars that went supernova and pose a larger threat to earth. According to O’Callaghan, “These can be just a dozen or so miles across, with one of the closest to us being Cygnus X-1 about 6,000 light-years away measuring 44 kilometers (27 miles) in diameter.”<br>
	In a series of events, this is what would happen if a black hole would pass through our solar system. First, the black hole would hit the Oort cloud. This is a cloud of ice and condensed gasses around our solar system. Its gravitational pull would suck up most of the cloud around it, as well as sending some chunks of ice and gasses throughout the solar system as comets. As it moved forward, Callahan explains, “...it would be invisible to us aside from a slight gravitational lensing effect on distant stars. It’s not until it started to tear gas from the outer gas giant planets that a noticeable accretion disk, a region of super-heated dust and gas, would form around the black hole. Now, the terrifying power of the black hole is all too visible to us on Earth” (Para. 5). Even if the black holes were several thousand times smaller than earth it would still have a gravity several times higher. This combined with it’s increasing size and mass due to the gas giants around earth would mean disaster for the earth. In literal seconds earth would be swept away and all that's left would be the sun. Luckily this probably won’t happen ever as the chances are way below 0.1%.</p>
