	<p class="paragraph1">Solar flares can be defined as a brief eruption of radiation from the sun’s surface. If solar flares are strong enough, they can wreak havoc on the earth. “We all know that major storms can wreak havoc, flooding cities and decimating infrastructure...If a massive solar storm hit us, our technology would be wiped out. The entire planet could go dark” (Stone Para. 1). Solar flares can also be classified in certain categories. These categories are, in order, C, M, and X. The smaller type flares, C and M flares, cause little real damage to the earth in whole. But what they can do is block signals from satellites in the sky. As said by Stone, "The one exception is radio. Radio signals between the Earth and orbiting satellites can be blocked when the atmosphere becomes too charged" (Para. 10). These are the only dangers of small solar flares, But what happens when they get much larger?<br>
	The X class storm, being the highest level on the scale, is for the large types of solar storms. These storms have a high expected damage rate. X scale flares are also placed in subcategories from X1 to X100 based on their expected damage. When an X class solar flare hits a larger more deadly threat typically comes with them in the form of a CME or Coronal Mass Ejection. A CME is when the sun's solar flare causes a large amount of plasma to be ejected from its surface at fast speeds. Most of the time earth is unaffected as they tend to miss. In the unlikely situation that it did make contact, the plasma would supercharge the atmosphere, causing things like transformers and entire power grids to short out and die. There isn’t much to do against it, but they are easy to spot and people can be warned when one is coming.</p>
